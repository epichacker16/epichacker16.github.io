    <h3> Dire Project</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Soldering and problem solving.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a hardware portal emulator for the games Disney Infinity, Lego Dimensions, and Skylanders; it tricks these games into thinking the original portal is present, then it injects the bin file of the character. This project seems simple but the problems that can occur range from simple sodering issues to difficult situations that require lots of reasearch, overall  this was a fun project to complete.  </p>

    <h3>surveillance system</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Collaboration, coding, troubleshooting, and hardware integration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project was the final capstone of my programming with Raspberry Pi class; the project is a surveillance system with facial recognition, motion sensing, a proximity sensor, and an audible buzzer. It was a group effort in which we split the work into four pieces (motion detection, facial recognition, proximity sensor, and the buzzer); There was lots of communication between group members as we worked on our parts to ensure a smooth transition to connect everything. Its functionality was to take a photo of the intruder; if recognized as a person while tracking the motion of an intruder, then an image of the person will be emailed to the homeowner. The other part was a proximity sensor that triggered the buzzer if a person got too close. The troubleshooting was simple on an individual level; however, the problem was combining all of the parts into one project because it required lots of teamwork to combine all of our separate work as they often conflicted with each other. Overall, this was a great experience of working in a team and creating a project with multiple people.</p>
